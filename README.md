Creating an SVG editor using 'oksvg' and 'rasterx' modules

This project is an attempt to bring together several things I've learned to write a more serious SVG editor in GO

- **OKsvg** has been forked from https://github.com/srwiley/oksvg to https://github.com/timskillman/oksvg

- **rasterx** has been forked from https://github.com/srwiley/rasterx to https://github.com/timskillman/rasterx

Both of these modules are undergoing a major revamp to enable SVG editing and lots of new features
